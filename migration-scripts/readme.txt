here are some migration scripts

Easiest Parts to Automate with Python Scripts:

    Namespace Addition: Adding namespaces and use statements to PHP files based on their directory structure.
    File Renaming and Class Renaming: Renaming migration files and class names to follow CI4 conventions.
    Directory Traversal: Automatically processing all PHP files in specified directories.

Parts Likely Needing Manual Intervention:

    Custom Logic and Compatibility Issues: Manually checking for custom business logic, compatibility issues, and adapting code that doesn't straightforwardly map from CI3 to CI4.
    Database Schema Changes: Updating database schemas, especially if they involve complex migration steps.
    Configuration Files: Updating and verifying configuration files, ensuring all settings are correctly adapted for CI4.
    Testing and Debugging: Running tests, debugging issues, and ensuring the application works correctly after migration.
